# Huffman compression
- Compresses files using the huffman-compression technique
- Achieves best results (compression ratios) if the given file has many repeated characters
- Can also encode and decode a string (legacy)
- Takes a file as inpu and spits out a compressed file

## Installation
- Build the executable using the cmd `make`
- Run the `huffman_compress` file with appropriate inputs
- Make sure to `make clean` before re-building

## Huffman Compression Process
- Each char from the input file is assigned a code in binary that is way shorter than 8 bits (size required to store a char)
- The input file is then encoded using these codes (known as the huffman codes)
- The compressed file's metadata consist of huffman codes + encoded data
- Huffman codes are generated by building a tree known as the huffman tree which internally uses a min-heap to pick out and insert the nodes to the tree
- Here's a detailed video on how huffman coding works by the OG [Abdul Bari](https://youtu.be/co4_ahEDCho?si=DdK29CKbY18DMJtk)
